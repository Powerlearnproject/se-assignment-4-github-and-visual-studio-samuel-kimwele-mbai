Ignored Files: A .gitignore file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git. This includes temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive information.
CONTRIBUTING.md:

- Contribution Guidelines: Detail the process for contributing to the project, including coding standards, pull request processes, and how to report issues.

- Code of Conduct:A CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file outlines expected behavior for contributors to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment.

- Issue Tracker:  Use the Issues tab to track bugs, feature requests, and other project-related tasks. 

- Branches:Use branches to work on different features or fixes. The main branch typically represents the stable version of the project, while other branches are used for development.

- Pull Requests: Use pull requests to propose changes, allowing team members to review and discuss before merging them into the main branch.<br>

Version Control with Git:
Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
- Version control systems (VCS) track changes to the source code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently without overwriting each other's work.<br>

- Key Concepts of Git:
1. Snapshots: Git stores data as snapshots of the project over time. Every time you commit a change, Git creates a snapshot of the file system at that moment.

2. Commits: A commit is a record of what changes were made and who made them.
3. Branches: Branches are used to create isolated environments for different lines of development. The main branch is typically the stable branch, while other branches can be used for features, bug fixes, or experiments.
4. Merging: Merging combines changes from different branches. Git can automatically merge changes if there are no conflicts, but if changes conflict, manual intervention is required.
5. Distributed System: Git is distributed, meaning each developer has a complete local copy of the repository, including its entire history. This allows for offline work and better collaboration.<br>

How GitHub Enhances Version Control for Developers:GitHub builds on the capabilities of Git by providing a cloud-based platform that offers additional tools and features to enhance version control and collaboration. Here are some ways GitHub enhances version control:
